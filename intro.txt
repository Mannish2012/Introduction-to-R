This is an introduction to R, a powerful program for numerical analysis and visualization. 
R can be used for anything from text mining to GIS. 

Like many other programming languages such as Python or Javascript, additional 'packages' can
be used to greatly augment the power of R. Because it is essentially meant for data analysis
and statistics, the number of packages available for R is significantly less than that available
for Python, which is a general purpose programming language. But for the purposes that it is
most useful for, R and its associated packages are second to none.
